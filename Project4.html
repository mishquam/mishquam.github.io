        <p class="title-one">E-Nable Hand</p>
        <p class="description-one"> For project 4, we were tasked with creating an e-nable phoenix hand. We were allowed to use the Raise3D printers for this project, which would have allowed us to print all components of the hand in one pass. However, we used PrusaSlicer and the Prusa Minis because the Rasie3Ds were occupied. We watched a Youtube video from MakerVerse on how to assemble the hand, as well as read an instruction manual from e-nabel. Overall, construction of the hand was straight forward, but the hand presented 2 challenges. Finger length and finger tension. On the hand there are 3 different archetypes of fingers, the thumb, the long middle and ring finger, and the shorter index and pinky finger. At first glance, all finger lengths appear to be the same. E-nabel’s written guide doesn’t specify the difference between any of the fingers, yet the video does specify the length difference. This caused us to misplace the fingers initially, we were able to get the fingers in the correct order after a second attempt. We also had trouble stringing the fingers. Rather than reading/watching the guides for stringing, I used the example hand as a reference, which individually stringed each finger.Individually stringing each finger created many inconsistencies with tension. The correct way was to string the pink and ring finger together and index and middle finger together, with the thumb having independent tension. We re-strung the fingers using the correct method and had a fully functional e-nable Phoenix Hand.</p>

        <p class="description-one"> Though both guides provided identical methods (boiling water mold) to shaping the gauntlet, we used PLA and a heat gun to shape the gauntlet. I had some difficulty with the molding because I didn't apply heat evenly which caused the gauntlet to be more square shaped rather than round. I had to constantly reapply heat and pressure to the mold to get the gauntlet into the correct shape.

        <p class="description-one">The next part of the project required us to innovate on the hand design. We chose to create a mechanism that would allow the user to adjust the tension of the fingers on demand. To do this, we designed screw heads that allowed the screws to be adjusted with one hand. We also printed a one hand crank from Thingiverse to further assist the wearer turn the screws

        <p class="description-one"> It was nice to complete a project where there were mechanics at play, with the articulating fingers. For my final project I hope that I can introduce some medchanics that I was able to learn about in this project.</p>
