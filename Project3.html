        <p class="title-one">Circuitry and Soldering</p>
        <p class="description-one"> For my third project, my partner Etai and I were assigned to solder together a simple circuit “sound-o-meter,” and design two containers for the circuit, one 3D printed and one laser cut. We first soldered the two identical circuits without any issues. This was my first exposure to soldering, which explains the spotty soldering job; regardless, it was quite fun. The circuit consisted of a row of LEDs, a sound sensor, a Texas Instruments chip, resistors, and capacitors. The circuit responded to sound and would light up LEDs in accordance with how loud the inputted sounds were.</p>

        <p class="description-one"> After completing the circuit, we sketched a general box idea for the “sound-o-meter.” We measured the distance between different components to determine how to design the box. Eventually, we decided to make separate boxes for the circuit and battery pack.

        <p class="title-one">3D Printed Boxes</p>
        <p class="description-one">I then started designing the boxes that would be 3D printed. I used a simple sliding hatch design to fit the circuit and battery pack. The walls of the boxes were 3 mm thick, and I gave approximately 2.5 mm of space in each direction for a comfortable fit. However, I forgot to give proper tolerances for the lid, a decision that would haunt me later.

        <a><image src="IMAGES/P3/3DCBProcess.png" class="Stop1"></image>
        <p class="description-one">My first print would fail, and the second would be completed without problems. Upon testing of the lid, the lack of tolerances would cause the 3D-printed boxes to break

        <p class="title-one">Laser Boxes</p>
        <p class="description-one"> For designing the laser boxes, I also used Fusion 360. Etai designed the circuit box, and I designed the battery box. Initially, there was some trouble with the design, as I needed to set parameters or constraints, and I had the incorrect wall thickness, prompting me to start over again. Creating the walls and base of the box wasn’t too difficult. I reused the measurements from the laser box because if the identical wall thickness of 3 mm. I started with a base and made 3 mm x 9 mm sized pegs on each face, and then created the other walls to have their pegs fit in the negative space. The overall result was perfect. </p>

        <p class="title-one">Reflection</p>
        <p class="description-one"> Overall, the project taught me a lot about design iteration and how to revise CAD and CAM prjects when an issues happen. Going forward I will take more preventative measures to ensure that my projects go smoothly.</p>
